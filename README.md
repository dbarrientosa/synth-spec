Scripts to generate synthetic spectroscopy for galaxies in cosmological simulations

The repository contains 3 folders:

  *   The python scripts to convert the SKIRT output datacubes into mock observations following a specific LSF FWHM, PSF FWHM, rebining factor and noise level (at 1 Re)
* aux_files/
  *  Additional files needed to run the script  
* ski_files/
  *   The .ski files used to run the radiative transfer simulations with SKIRT
